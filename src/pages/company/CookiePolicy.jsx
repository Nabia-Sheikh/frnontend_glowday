                                <h4><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h4>
                                <p>A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your computer or mobile device
                                    when you visit our website. We, and some third-party service providers, use cookies
                                    on our website. Some are persistent cookies (cookies that remain on your hard drive
                                    for an extended period of time) and some are session ID cookies (cookies that expire
                                    when you close your browser).</p>
                                <p>We also use other tracking technologies like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking
                                    beacons” or “clear gifs”) and local storage.&nbsp;These are tiny graphics files that
                                    contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our
                                    websites or opened an email that we have sent them.</p>
                                <p>You can find more information about cookies at <a
                                        href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a> and

                                <h4><strong>How we use cookies.</strong></h4>
                                <p>We use cookies to collect information and to make your experience of our website more
                                    user friendly and to find out more about user behaviour on an anonymous basis. This
                                    document sets out more about the types of cookies we use, and why. </p>
                                <p>Cookies help us to operate our websites and services, enhance and customise your
                                    experience across our websites and services, perform analytics.</p>
                                <p>Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or
                                    through our websites and services, such as interactive content and analytics.</p>
                                <h4><strong>What cookies do we use?</strong></h4>
                                <p>In the tables below you can see a description of each cookie that we use, what it
                                    does and when its expires.</p>
                                <p>Microsoft Application Insights: used to monitor the health and status of the server
                                    and website. Expires in 1 year.</p>
                                <p>ARRAffinity: Used to distribute traffic to the website on several servers in order to
                                    optimise response times. Expires at end of session.</p>
                                <p>We also use Google Analytics to monitor how our website is used. Google Analytics
                                    collects information anonymously and generates reports detailing information such as
                                    the number of visits to the system, where visitors generally came from, how long
                                    they stayed on the system, and which pages they visited. Google Analytics places
                                    several persistent cookies on your computer’s hard drive. These do not collect any
                                    personal data. If you do not agree to this you can disable persistent cookies in
                                    your browser. This will prevent Google Analytics from logging your visits.</p>
                                <p>We also use social media buttons and/or plugins on this site that allow you to
                                    connect with your social network in various ways. For these to work the relevant
                                    social media sites (such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram) will set cookies
                                    through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or
                                    contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective
                                    privacy policies.</p>
                                <h4><strong>How can you control cookies?</strong></h4>
                                <p>You can accept or reject cookies by amending your web browser controls. But if you
                                    choose not to allow the use of cookies, your experience of our websites will be
                                    limited and many integral aspects might not work at all.</p>
                                <p>To change your cookie settings, or if you want to be notified each time a cookie is
                                    about to be used, you should amend the settings provided in your web browser to
                                    prevent us from storing cookies on your computer hard drive.</p>
