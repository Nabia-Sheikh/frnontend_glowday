                                obligations so please read them carefully. If you do not agree to be bound by these

                            <p>We reserve the right to amend these Client Terms from time to time at our discretion.
                                We may do so for technical or legal reasons, or because the needs of our business
                                have changed. You agree that if you do not accept any amendment to our Client Terms
                                then you shall immediately stop accessing and/or using the Site. If we reasonably
                                believe that the amendment is significant, we shall notify all registered users by
                                email. Otherwise, the amended Client Terms will be effective as soon as they are
                                accessible. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Client Terms so that
                                you are aware of any amendments.</p>
                            <p>The Site operates as a platform for clinics (<strong>Clinics</strong>) who provide
                                procedures that focus on improving cosmetic appearance (<strong>Aesthetic
                                    Procedure</strong>) to promote their Aesthetic Procedures, and for Clients to
                                connect, book and pay for Aesthetic Procedures. Glowery does not provide Aesthetic
                                Procedures itself or procure that the Clinic will provide any Aesthetic Procedure.

                            <p>2.<strong>Registering on the Site and Use of the Site</strong></p>

                                at at <a href="mailto:support@glowday.com">support@glowday.com</a>if you believe

                            <p><strong>3.Payment and Cancellation</strong></p>
                            <p>You shall authorise full payment for the Aesthetic Procedure upon making a booking,
                                though funds will not leave your account until after the Aesthetic Procedure has
                                taken place. Payment is made through our payment service provider, Stripe. By
                                booking an Aesthetic Procedure, you authorise Stripe and Glowday to process payment
                                of the fee together with any payment processing charge imposed by Stripe. Glowday
                                accepts payment as an agent of the Clinic. Your booking will be confirmed by us by
                                email when we are authorised to take payment in full.</p>
                            <p>Please take care when booking an Aesthetic Procedure and carefully check the
                                location, time and date to make sure that information is correct. You should also
                                take the time to read a Clinic’s Cancellation and No Show Policy. </p>
                            <p>If a Clinic is for any reason unable to provide the Aesthetic Procedure, the Clinic
                                should notify you before cancelling, either by the email address or telephone number
                                associated with your account.</p>
                            <p>You may cancel or re-schedule an Aesthetic Procedure at any time, but be mindful of
                                the Cancellation and No Show Policy of the Clinic which can be enforced. </p>

                                review on the Site, but you should also contact the Clinic. You may also contact
                                your local Trading Standard Office and/or Citizen’s Advice Bureau.</p>

                                damage you suffer as a result if that loss and/or damage is foreseeable. Loss or
                                damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our negligence or breach of
                                contract, or would have been considered by you and us to be a likely consequence of

                                remain in full force and effect. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                                provision of these Client Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                                provision. We may assign or otherwise transfer our rights and obligations under
                                these Client Terms to any third party.</p>
