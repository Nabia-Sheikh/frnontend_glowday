                    Right to rectification: You can require us to correct errors
                    in the personal data that we process for you if it is
                    inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Right to restriction of processing: In certain
                    circumstances, you have the right to require that we
                    restrict the processing of your personal information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right to be forgotten: You also have the right at any time
                    to require that we delete the personal data that we hold for
                    you, where it is no longer necessary for us to hold it.
                    However, whilst we respect your right to be forgotten, we
                    may still retain your personal data in accordance with
                    applicable laws.
