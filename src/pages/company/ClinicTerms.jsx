                                    represent that the content in the Clinic Profile must not:</p>
                                <p>(a) breach the provisions of any law, statute or regulation including any data

                                <p>3.4 Clinics must upload to the Clinic Profile a copy of their treatment menu and Fees
                                    for a Client to review before booking an Aesthetic Procedure. Clinic admins have the
                                    ability to invite practitioners who are practicing at their Clinic to also create a
                                    Practitioner Profile.</p>
                                <p>3.5 We may remove any content from a Clinic Profile or Practitioner Profile at any
                                    time and without notice if we reasonably believe that such content infringes any of
                                    the provisions of these Clinic Terms. We will verify a practitioner’s membership of
                                    either the NMC, GMC, GDC and the GPhc ahead of publishing to Glowday and every seven
                                    days thereafter, to ensure all practitioners on Glowday are eligible to be listed on
                                    Glowday.</p>
                                <p>3.6 When you register on the Site you will create a username and password. You are
                                    responsible for keeping your username and password confidential and you are
                                    responsible for any activity under your Glowday account. Please take precautions to
                                    protect your password and contact us immediately by email at support@glowday.com if
                                    you believe there has been any unauthorised use of your Glowday account.</p>
                                <p>3.7 The Clinic must also keep its schedule of availability for Aesthetic Procedures
                                    up-to-date within the Site. The Clinic agrees that the Clients rely on the accuracy
                                    of a Clinic’s schedule, and if the schedule is frequently found to be out of date
                                    and the Clinic cancels Aesthetic Procedures, this shall be considered a material
                                    breach of these Clinic Terms.</p>
                                <p><strong>4. Fees, Commission and Payment</strong></p>
                                <p>4.1 Clients shall authorise the Fee for each Aesthetic Procedure when the Aesthetic
                                    Procedure is booked and we will take payment upon the Aesthetic Procedure being
                                    conducted. </p>
                                <p>Payment is made through our payment service provider, Stripe. Clinics acknowledge
                                    that Glowday acts as a Clinic’s agent to receive the Fee for an Aesthetic Procedure
                                    booked through the Site.</p>
                                <p>4.2 Clinic fees will be deposited into the Clinic’s Stripe account once a treatment
                                    has taken place and can draw down payment from this account, minus the commission
                                    element (and VAT) into their business bank account. We shall notify the Clinic by
                                    email of any changes to the calculation of the Commission from time to time.</p>
                                <p>4.3 If the Client books an Aesthetic Procedure on the Site, the Clinic <strong>shall
                                        not</strong> attempt to circumvent payment of the Fee and Commission to Glowday.
                                    In particular, the Clinic shall not:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Cancel the Glowday Booking and remove the Client from the Glowday Diary.</li>
                                    <li>Encourage the Client to cancel the Aesthetic Procedure and re-book directly with
                                        the Clinic.</li>
                                    <li>Request direct payment for the Aesthetic Procedure from the Client.</li>
                                    <li>Conduct a consultation, which converts into an Aesthetic Procedure but payment
                                        is then taken direct and not through Glowday.</li>
                                    <li>Fail to complete the Glowday treatment card for a Glowday Booking.</li>
                                    <li>Conduct a consultation and at a later date, not add the patient to the Glowday
                                        platform for their subsequent treatment. </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>4.4 The Clinic must complete the Glowday Treatment Card immediately after the
                                    treatment has been conducted and whilst the patient is on the premises. The Clinic
                                    takes responsibility for pressing the 'take payment' button upon completion of the
                                    treatment card. Clinics must not delay in completing treatment cards and taking
                                    payment. For the avoidance of doubt, where card payments fail and the Clinic hasn't
                                    taken the necessary steps to take payment through an alternative means, Glowday
                                    takes no responsibility and isn't liable for the cost of the treatment or associated
                                    product sales. </p>
                                <p>A breach of Conditions 4.3 shall constitute a material breach of these Terms, and
                                    Glowday shall be entitled to suspend or terminate a Clinic’s account and invoice the
                                    Clinic £100 for any Glowday Booking, to be paid within 30 days of receipt of the
                                    invoice, to cover the cost of the Glowday Booking, administration fees and any
                                    damages in respect of any loss suffered as a result. Failure to pay within 30 days
                                    of receipt of the invoice will result in debt recovery measures which may impact on
                                    a Clinic’s credit rating.</p>
                                <p>4.5 Glowday shall, on reasonable notice to the Clinic, be entitled to audit all
                                    payment records relating to a Client and the Clinic to ensure compliance with
                                    Condition 4.3 and payment of all Commissions due.</p>
                                <p>If following the audit, there is found to be a breach of Condition 4.3 the Clinic
                                    shall promptly pay to Glowday all sums due, together with the costs of the audit and
                                    enforcement of this condition.</p>
                                <p>4.6 The Clinic agrees that it is not an employee of Glowday. The Clinic is
                                    responsible for making appropriate tax due in respect of the Fee, and the Clinic
                                    shall indemnify Glowday (on a full indemnity basis) in respect of any claims or
                                    demands which may be made by the relevant authorities against Glowday in respect of
                                    the payment of any such taxes, including any interest or penalties and any costs or
                                    expenses we incur in relation to the claim.</p>
                                <p>4.7 The Clinic may convert a Consultation booking to an Aesthetic Procedure during
                                    the Consultation.</p>
                                <p>- Consultation bookings have a 0% commission charge.</p>
                                <p>- If a Consultation converts into an Aesthetic Procedure, a commission of 30% (+ VAT)
                                    for a Glowday Clients first Aesthetic Procedure(s). </p>
                                <p>- No commission is charged for any appointment added to the Practitioner's Glowday
                                    Diary (walk-in, phone, DM/social or an existing patient).</p>
                                <p>- No commission is charged on direct bookings made via the Practitioner's unique 0%
                                    link, provided to each Practitioner in their Glowday dashboard.</p>
                                <p>4.8 Clinics and Practitioners must provide price parity or a price discount between a
                                    direct clinic booking and a booking made through Glowday.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Treatment prices listed on a Practitioner’s Glowday Profile must be equal to, or
                                        less than, those available when a Client books direct with a
                                        Practitioner/Clinic.</li>
                                    <li>Clinics may discount treatments, but Glowday will still retain the commission
                                        value calculated on the price of the treatment at the point of booking. The
                                        Glowday platform will not allow the discount to drop beneath the value required
                                        to collect the original commission value.<br/></li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>4.9 On occasion a Clients card used for making a payment for an Aesthetic Procedure
                                    may fail, despite the card having been authorised for payment at the point of
                                    booking. </p>
                                <p>The reason for the card failure will be returned by the card-issuing bank and
                                    presented in the dashboard. When a card failure occurs, you should use a POS device,
                                    take a cash payment or bank transfer. </p>
                                <p>Glowday, do not take any responsibility for failed payments and is not responsible
                                    for reimbursing Clinics where a failed payment occurs and they haven't recovered the
                                    payment using a POS machine, cash or bank transfer. Failed payments will not result
                                    in a Client review as the Aesthetic Procedure could not be verified.</p>
                                <p><strong>5. Provision of Aesthetic Procedures </strong></p>
                                <p>5.1 You are entirely responsible for providing the Aesthetic Procedures to Clients,
                                    but you agree to do so with reasonable skill and care and to the best of your
                                    ability. You agree that before administering an Aesthetic Procedure, you will carry
                                    out a thorough consultation and informed consent. You will explain to a Client all
                                    of the risks and possible side effects and likely outcomes associated with the
                                    Aesthetic Procedure. You will not represent any outcome in respect of an Aesthetic

                                    the contract for those Aesthetic Procedures is between the Clinic and the Client. We
                                    are in no way liable to Clients for the Aesthetic Procedures they receive from you.

                                <p>5.3 Clinics shall only process Client Personal Data in accordance with the Data
                                    Protection Legislation. In particular, Clinics shall take appropriate security
                                    measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard
                                    such personal data from unauthorised access, loss and disclosure.</p>
                                <p>5.4 Consistent with the highest professional standards, a practitioner may decide not
                                    to treat a patient, and in these circumstances, should make a note in the treatment
                                    card within the diary and cancel the treatment.</p>

                                <p>7.1 If a Clinic is for any reason unable to provide the Aesthetic Procedure, the
                                    Clinic shall immediately notify the Client and shall attempt to reschedule.</p>
                                <p>7.2 A Client is entitled to re-schedule or cancel an Aesthetic Procedure. A Client
                                    will have been made aware at point of booking the Aesthetic Procedure the
                                    Cancellation and No Show Policy of The Clinic. A Clinic can choose to waiver or
                                    enforce their Cancellation and No Show Policy. Any fees arising from a Cancellation
                                    will be treated in accordance with the existing commission arrangement with Glowday.

                                </p>
                                <p>14.2 If any provision of these Clinic Terms is held by a court of competent
                                    jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be construed,
                                    as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and all other
                                    provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                                <p>14.3 Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Clinic Terms
                                    shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
                                <p>14.4 We may assign or otherwise transfer our rights and obligations under these
                                    Clinic Terms to third parties.</p>

                                <p><strong>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>
                                <p>15.1 These Clinic Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English
                                    law and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.</p>
                                <p><strong>16. Stripe Payments</strong></p>
                                <p>16.1 All clinics must accept the Stripe terms and conditions and open a Stripe
                                    account in order to process client bookings.</p>
                                <p>16.2 The name Stripe may appear as the booking reference on client statements, rather
                                    than the name of your Clinic.</p>
                                <p>16.3 Stripe will charge Clinics a 1.69% fee on all payments from European cards, plus
                                    a 20p transaction fee. For non-European cards, including those from the USA, Stripe
                                    charge 2.9% + 20p per transaction. </p>
                                <p>16.4 Stripe will automatically take the Glowday commission before depositing funds
                                    into the relevant Clinic/Practitioner Stripe account.</p>
                                <p>16.5 The first Stripe payout takes approximately 7 days after the first successful
                                    payment. Subsequent payouts operate on a 3 day rolling payout basis. Glowday is not
                                    responsible in delays to payouts.</p>
                                <p><strong>17. Professional Photography</strong></p>
                                <p>17.1 Clinics purchasing professional photography from Glowday agree to provide access

                                    professional photographs. </p>
                                <p>17.4 At Glowday's discretion it may choose to mock-up and publish the photographs to
                                    Glowday subject to the Clinics consent. </p>
                                <p>17.5 In the event a Clinic is not satisfied with its professional photography, an
                                    email should be sent to support@glowday.com in the first instance. </p>
                                <p>17.6 Clinics may use their Glowday Professional Photography across all media and not
