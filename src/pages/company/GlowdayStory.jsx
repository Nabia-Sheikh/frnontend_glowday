                  Feeling confident can mean different things to different
                  people. For some, it’s about what they wear, for others it’s
                  about having refreshed, rejuvenated skin - and if it makes you
                  feel great, it can only be a good thing.{" "}

                  <strong>The short version…</strong>Glowday makes booking
                  aesthetic treatments easy - connecting people confidently with
                  medically qualified professionals. We give practitioners a
                  home to showcase their amazing reviews and before and after
                  photos, and allow them to build their local reputation.&nbsp;

                  <strong>The long story from Hannah, our Founder</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few months of squinting in the Sydney sunshine made my ‘11s’
                  more apparent than ever. That was it - Botox was on the cards!
                  But there wasn’t <em>one</em> single place where I could find
                  everything I needed to know about the treatment, so I spent
                  evening after evening researching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, I found a Doctor locally via Facebook, but I had
                  no idea about cost, what I should be asking for, how many
                  units I’d need, whether the practitioner’s reviews were
                  legitimate - or even whether she was <em>actually</em>{" "}
                  medically qualified.&nbsp; After my first treatment, I was
                  hooked. Goodbye frown lines! But when I came back to the UK, I
                  was faced with the same issue: who to see, how much it would
                  cost, etc, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a round of Messenger pingpong with a local clinic, a
                  lightbulb moment occurred and the idea for Glowday, was born.
                  A place to book treatments with medically qualified
                  practitioners - <em>and</em> all the information you need on
                  non-invasive aesthetic treatments.&nbsp;{" "}
