                            Mary, goes above and beyond for her patients and
                            makes you feel at real ease throughout the whole

                            objective is the same as yours- to make you feel and

                          So glad I found Kate! All the reviews i read before
                          contacting her are true. She was lovely from the get
                          go and put me at ease before we even met in person.
                          She explained everything in a down to earth way, and
                          thoroughly answered every question i had no matter how
                          small. Very professional attitude and atmosphere, and
                          the environment was spotlessly clean. Treatment was
                          virtually painless and I couldn't feel the injections
                          really (which was a pleasant surprise when you have a
                          genuine phobia of needles ðŸ¤£!)

                            Julie was fantastic, from the minute I booked the
                            service was 5 star, she managed to fit me in at a
                            more convenient date and time to suit me than the
                            initial date Iâ€™d booked.

                            She went through every aspect of the treatment and
                            was extremely thorough!

                          <p>
                            Sheâ€™s very knowledgeable in her field and you feel
                            at ease immediately! I was slightly nervous as it
                            was my first time but Julie made me feel comfortable
                            and took her time to help ease me into it.

                          Jade is such a kind professional. Iâ€™m afraid of
                          needles and for my first time she was so sweet and
                          made me feel very comfortable. Sheâ€™s also amazing
                          about fixing things if Iâ€™m not completely satisfied.
                          She always answers my concerns if Iâ€™m nervous after
                          treatment. I can honestly say Iâ€™ve never felt more
                          confident about my lips until now. Plus, she is
                          constantly improving and giving her clients the best
                          experience she can. My 3rd time going to her, she now
                          has even better needles and I barely feel any pain
                          when she is doing the filler. Overall, always a good
                          experience, I will keep come back to her not only
                          because of her skilled work but also because of how
                          much she cares about her clients.

                          <p>
                            I have considered having treatment for some time but
                            was a bit nervous. After contacting Helen by phone
                            to have a quick chat I was immediately put at ease.
                            I booked in a consultation and went along to meet
                            Helen.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            She was great from the start discussed my hopes for
                            the treatment and fully explained every step to me.
                            I was made aware of the side affects and given time
                            to make my decision.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I decided to have some Botox in 3 areas and some lip
                            filler around my lips to soften the lines.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            These appointments were done a week apart so I had a
                            chance to see each treatment take affect.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The results have been amazing. My lines on my
                            forehead are so much softer and it looks natural. I
                            have movement still but my deep wrinkles are gone.
                            My lips are beautiful I have always had thin lips
                            with a lot of wrinkles around them but now the lines
                            are softer and my lips look fuller.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Overall I am extremely happy with the treatment
                            received. My face looks so much fresher but most
                            importantly for me it looks natural.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I would certainly recommend Helen to my friends and
                            family. From start to finish Helen is thorough and
                            attentive, she messages afterwards to check if
                            everything is ok and reassures you if you have
                            concerns to call her at any time!
                          </p>
                          <p />
                          <p>
                            Besides the treatment Helen offers/gives which is
                            10/10 in my opinion, she is a truly lovely person
                            who cares for her clients beyond her job.

                          So happy with the effects from my cheek and chin
                          fillers, I was extremely worried as this was my first
                          attempt at any enhancements. Dr Jess was so
                          professional, understanding and supportive and I
                          really appreciated that. The set up with Dr Jess is
                          immaculate, but more importantly her experiences as a
                          doctor really help give confidence. The results are
                          just brilliant, enhancing the areas which gave me
                          concerns without being obvious to the rest of the
                          world, just what I wanted. Thank you and already

                          First ever treatment and chose to go to Claire after
                          seeing previous reviews, Claire explained everything
                          she was doing and I felt safe in her hands, Iâ€™m very
                          pleased with the results. The room was scrupulously
                          clean and hygienic, very light and airy and would
                          definitely recommend her to others.

                          She is AMAZING! I have been to Cheryl a few times now
                          and everytime I leave, not only do I leave happy but I
                          learn something new! She talks me through everything
                          sheâ€™s doing step by step, she makes me feel calm &amp;
                          comfortable and I know Iâ€™m in the right hands!
                          Treatment wise she will always go through the pros
                          &amp; cons advising the best course of action. Most of
                          the time Iâ€™m walking in with my head down insecure
                          about something, but I walk out after my appointment
                          on cloud nine!! Couldnâ€™t recommend her enough!! :)

                          Kelsey is absolutely excellent. The whole experience
                          from start to finish was not only professional with
                          amazing results, but also really enjoyable. Kelsey has
                          great energy and takes the times to get to know you
                          and your needs to give you the best results possible.
                          Highly, highly recommended. Can't wait to go back.
