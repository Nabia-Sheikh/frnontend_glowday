                        Laser treatments are commonly associated with hair
                        removal, but the use of light, in various forms, has
                        been used since the 1960s for a myriad of skin issues
                        such as sun-damage, pigmentation, lines and wrinkles,
                        tattoo removal and stretch mark reduction.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the last decade, there have been significant advances
                        in the use of lasers in the world of aesthetics. Due to
                        the adjustable nature of the laser machines, treatments
                        can be used on most skin types, colours and areas,
                        including around the eyes, lips and eyelids.
                      </p>
                      <h4>What is laser and how does it work?</h4>
                      <p>
                        Laser is a very high energy beam of laser light.
                        Different lasers can be set to different wavelengths of
                        light, so their strength and depth of penetration can be
                        varied.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The laser beam heats up water in skin cells, at a
                        specific depth, causing them either to vaporise or
                        injure them in a controlled way. This intentional,
                        controlled cell damage leads to new, thicker layers of
                        skin with increased levels of elastin and collagen being
                        made. Resulting in younger, more even, healthier looking
                        skin with fewer lines, wrinkles and pigmentation.
                      </p>
                      <h4>What are the different types of laser?</h4>
                      <p>There are various categories of laser:</p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Ablative lasers</strong> – these completely
                        remove the epidermis and some of the dermis by
                        vapourising the skin cells. This means that the skin is
                        effectively removed to a specific depth causing a
                        resurfacing effect. New skin cells are made to repair
                        the intentional injury sustained by the skin. This
                        results in thicker, smoother skin. Ablative laser
                        treatments produce dramatic results but this comes with
                        significant discomfort and downtime. Following an
                        ablative laser treatment, skin will be red, weeping,
                        sore and itchy. Think of the worse sunburn you've ever
                        had, and then some. The adage "No pain, no gain" really
                        applied.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Non-ablative lasers</strong> – these cause
                        controlled tissue injury in the dermis by heating it to
                        a specific temperature and depth, leaving the epidermis
                        intact. Non-ablative lasers lead to extensive dermal
                        remodelling, where collagen is tightened, and
                        fibroblasts are stimulated to produce additional
                        collagen and elastin. Results are more moderate than
                        ablative lasers, but there is no downtime, no peeling
                        and only short-lived redness. So, the results are still
                        great, but you'd likely need more treatments to get
                        anywhere near the results of one ablative laser
                        treatment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There's another layer of complication with lasers. Both
                        ablative and non-ablative lasers can be either
                        <strong>fractional</strong> or
                        <strong>non-fractional</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Non-fractional lasers</strong> treat the whole
                        area exposed to the laser. Non-fractional laser
                        treatments are more aggressive than fractional laser
                        treatments.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Fractional lasers</strong> treat a portion of
                        the area exposed to the laser (i.e. they treat a
                        fraction of the skin). This leaves channels of laser
                        treated tissue (called Microscopic Thermal Zones - MTZs)
                        surrounded by healthy, untreated tissue. This means that
                        recovery times and side effects are much reduced
                        compared to non-fractional lasers.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Can anyone have laser?</h4>
                      <p>
                        There have been real advances in laser technology in
                        recent years, meaning that there are now lasers suitable
                        for all skin tones. However, NEVER allow just anyone
                        near your skin with a laser as the potential risks are
                        significant. Ensure that your practitioner has knoweldge
                        and experience in treating your particular skin issue,
                        especially if you have brown or black skin.
                      </p>
                      <h4>How can they tell laser is OK for your skin?</h4>
                      <p>
                        Prior to any laser treatments, you should be asked to
                        complete a Fitzpatrick Test. This will enable your
                        practitioner to determine the correct wavelength for
                        your hair colour, skin colour and type.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A patch test will also be carried out on each area you
                        are going to have treated at
                        <strong>least 24 hours</strong> prior to your treatment
                        taking place. This will help determine whether you have
                        any unwanted reaction to the laser treatment.
                      </p>
                      <h4>How much is it going to cost?</h4>
                      <p>
                        The cost of laser varies depending on the type of laser
                        and the area to be treated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For non-ablative laser treatments, expect to pay
                        anywhere from £200 to £600 for a single treatment and
                        £2000 to £3000 for a full face.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ablative treatments are more costly. A small area (e.g.
                        around eyes) can cost upwards of £1000, with a full-face
                        costing £4000 or more.
                      </p>
